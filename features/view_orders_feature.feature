Feature: view all raffle orders

  As a site administrator
  So that I can keep track of all raffle orders so far
  I want to be able to view all existing raffle orders

Background: orders exist in the database
  Given the following basic order details exist:
  |first_name   | last_name | phone     | quantity  |
  |Joe          | Smith     |1234567890 | 2         |
  |Foo          | Bar       |2233121122 | 1         |

  And the following electronic raffle orders exist:
  | title        | rating | director     | release_date |
  | Star Wars    | PG     | George Lucas |   1977-05-25 |
  | Blade Runner | PG     | Ridley Scott |   1982-06-25 |
  

Scenario: add director to existing movie
  When I go to the edit page for "Alien"
  And  I fill in "Director" with "Ridley Scott"
  And  I press "Update Movie Info"
  Then the director of "Alien" should be "Ridley Scott"

Scenario: find movie with same director
  Given I am on the details page for "Star Wars"
  When  I follow "Find Movies With Same Director"
  Then  I should be on the Similar Movies page for "Star Wars"
  And   I should see "THX-1138"
  But   I should not see "Blade Runner"

Scenario: can't find similar movies if we don't know director (sad path)
  Given I am on the details page for "Alien"
  Then  I should not see "Ridley Scott"
  When  I follow "Find Movies With Same Director"
  Then  I should be on the home page
  And   I should see "'Alien' has no director info"
